# CodeAlpha\_CreditScoringModel

This project was completed as part of my **Machine Learning Internship with CodeAlpha**.
The goal is to build a **Credit Scoring Model** that predicts an individual's creditworthiness using financial data.

---

## 📌 Objective

Predict whether a person is **creditworthy (1)** or **not creditworthy (0)** based on their past financial records.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* Python 🐍
* Pandas, NumPy (data preprocessing)
* Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest)
* Matplotlib, Seaborn (visualization)

---

## 📊 Dataset

* Dataset: **credit\_data.csv** (synthetic dataset of 2000 rows created for this task)
* Features include:

  * Income, Age, Employment Years, Debt-to-Income Ratio
  * Credit History, Previous Defaults, Loan Amount, Savings, Expenses
  * Engineered Features (Loan-to-Income Ratio, Disposable Income, etc.)
* Target variable:

  * `creditworthy` → 1 = Good credit, 0 = Risky

---

## 🚀 Approach

1. Load and preprocess dataset
2. Feature engineering and scaling
3. Train models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest
4. Evaluate using metrics:

   * Accuracy
   * Precision
   * Recall
   * F1-Score
   * ROC-AUC

---

## 📈 Results (Sample)

| Model               | Accuracy | Precision | Recall   | F1-Score | ROC-AUC  |
| ------------------- | -------- | --------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Logistic Regression | 0.87     | 0.84      | 0.80     | 0.82     | 0.88     |
| Decision Tree       | 0.85     | 0.81      | 0.83     | 0.82     | 0.85     |
| Random Forest       | **0.91** | **0.89**  | **0.87** | **0.88** | **0.93** |

✅ **Random Forest performed best overall.**
